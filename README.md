# iOS Technical Challenge

We've been asked to rebuild the Moonpig iOS app using the latest best practices and you are part of a team working on the proof of concept. We'd like you to build a simple app which will display a list of cards that a customer can buy using our API.

It should meet the following use case:

> As a customer I can view a list of available cards so that I can celebrate my new job

## Wireframes

### Card Listings View

We are more interested in your approach to solving this problem than if you fully solve it. Doing less "well" is preferable to doing more "less well" ðŸ˜‰. We also appreciate that your free time is important. Therefore if you feel your code is unfinished please leave some notes in your README.md explaining what you would do next, given more time. We are more than happy to review this.

## API

### Search Cards

```
curl "https://search.moonpig.com/api/products?size=12&searchFacets=occasion_level_3:occasion%3Ewell%20done%3Enew%20job"
```

## Tools, libraries and frameworks

We'll be using Xcode to build and run your application, so please ensure that your project is compatible with the latest macOS App Store release.

If you do decide to use any external dependencies, please note them down in the readme along with your justifications.

## Assessment

We will assess the task based on the following criteria:

- README provided
- How clean, modular and extensible the code is
- Approach to testing
- How it looks visually and the techniques used to style the application
